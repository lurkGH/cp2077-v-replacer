<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This is a currently unreleased mod for Cyberpunk 2077 which allows the user to swap out the player character in Photo Mode (either V or Johnny) with almost any NPC in the game.</p>
<p>Since it has not yet been published to Nexus, this repo is intentionally missing key files necessary for the mod to function properly in-game.</p>
<p>This mod is ready for release, but because of the recent 2.2 patch to Cyberpunk 2077, there are other situations out of my control that must be resolved before I can publish it.</p>
<p>Hopefully it should be available for use soon!</p>
